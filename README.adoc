= DualMice - Multi-Cursor Support and Enhanced Copy-Paste for macOS

`DualMice` is a tool for macOS that adds:

* *Multi-Cursor Support*: Each connected mouse controls its own independent virtual cursor, with the system cursor managed by the primary mouse.
* *Copy-Paste Functionality*: Automatically copy and paste text or objects based on mouse actions, similar to the middle-click behavior in Linux systems.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dualmice.git
   cd dualmice
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
This will:

* Compile the program.
* Copy the binary to $HOME/bin.
* Set up the program to run automatically at login.
